1. Create a directory (eg C:\pharlap) to place the downloaded pharlap.zip file
   and extract the software

2. Define the environment variable DIR_MODELS_REF_DAT to point to the reference 
   data files. These files live in the 'dat' subdirectory (eg C:\pharlap\dat). 
   
   a. Put the following command in your matlab startup file:

           setenv('DIR_MODELS_REF_DAT', '<path to data>')

      where <path to data> is the directory where the reference data lives
      (e.g. ~/pharlap/dat or C:\pharlap\dat)

      OR...
 
    b. Set the environment variable at the system level. 
       	  (i)  Windows 7: Open control panel, search for "environment variable",
                          click on the resultant link, click New and enter the
                          details
          (ii) Linux / Mac OSX : edit your .bash_profile appropriately 

3. Note that if Matlab is run over a network on a different node to where
   PHaRLAP is installed then routines which rely on the reference data (e.g. the
   ionospheric, geomagnetic and ground scattering loss models) may run
   substantially slower.

4. Start matlab and add the installation directory (e.g. C:\pharlap) the path. 
   Make sure that you include the subdirectories!

5. At the Matlab prompt type:
     "help pharlap" to obtain top-level help and a list of routines. 
     "help <routine>" to obtain help on a specific routine

6. Example code resides in the directory :
        <pharlap install dir>/src/matlab/examples

7. PHaRLAP may not run with a different version of Matlab from that which it
   was compiled. See RELEASE_NOTES.txt for details on the version of Matlab
   to use with PHaRLAP.

   If you do not have access to or are unable to install the relevant version
   of Matlab you can try installing the appropriate Intel Fortran redistributable
   libraries available from here:
